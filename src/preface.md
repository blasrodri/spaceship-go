# Preface

Welcome, traveler! This is a set of notes of my journey into part of Go's
standard library, comprised into a book. I hope you enjoy it!
Each chapter provides a dive into some packages. I will provide a brief
introduction of what is the main purpose of the package, and some examples to
help to understand. In some cases, I will add some references to external
content that work either as a complementary view to the topic, or even to extend
the coverage of the subject.

## Who is this book for?

Ideally you are a software developer, or someone with great interest in how to write
code. Having an understanding on the syntax and certain command of the Go programming
language will certainly help. However, I will try to keep the explanations as
simple as possible in order to be able to reach to a larger audience. And
hopefully, this will still be found interesting for those looking for getting
a deeper understanding of what tools the language and its runtime has to offer.

## Feedback and comments

This book is built entirely using markdown. And it's also hosted publicly on GitHub.
For comments, issues, or any kind of feedback, please use the
[Spaceship Go](https://github.com/blasrodri/spaceship-go) repository. PR's are more
than welcome, of any type!

## Special thanks

Most of the book is just my interpretation of the Go's standard library. Besides this, I've
found that the Go Blog is an extremely useful resource. Big thanks especially
to Andrew Gerrand, for all the great contributions he has in that space.

There is also a YouTube channel called **just for func**, which I also highly
recommend. It was particularly useful to prepare the groundwork for the `Context`
chapter. Thanks to its creator, Francesc Campoy.

The cover of the book is based on original work from [egonelbre gophers repo](https://github.com/egonelbre/gophers)
